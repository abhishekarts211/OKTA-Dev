Database connection and query:

The main method connects to an Oracle database using JDBC, fetches user records using an SQL query, and passes the results to the Run method for Okta provisioning.

API call to Okta:

The Run method sends user data to Okta via an HTTPS POST request. This method reads the Okta API configuration (URL, token) from a properties file and constructs a JSON payload containing user details.

Error handling:

The try-catch-finally blocks handle any exceptions that may occur during database interaction or API calls. The finally block ensures that resources (like the output stream) are closed properly.


Thread Pool (ExecutorService):

Created a thread pool with Executors.newFixedThreadPool(THREAD_POOL_SIZE) to handle multiple tasks concurrently.
The pool size is configurable and depends on system resources.


Batch Processing:

Instead of migrating users one at a time, the code now processes users in batches (e.g., 1000 users per batch). This reduces overhead and improves performance.
Each batch is processed as a separate task by implementing the Callable<String> interface.
User Class:

Added a simple User class to hold the user attributes (login, first name, last name, email, and mobile phone).


Callable Tasks:

Each batch of users is handled by a UserMigrationTask, which is executed by the thread pool. This allows concurrent migration for different batches.
The call method processes each user in the batch by invoking the migrateUserToOkta method.


Logging and Error Handling:

Each batch logs when it completes, and any errors are printed with clear messages.

How It Works:
Users are fetched from the Oracle database in batches.
Each batch is submitted as a separate task to the thread pool for concurrent processing.
The migrateUserToOkta method is used to send user data to Okta via the API.
The thread pool processes all tasks in parallel, speeding up the migration process.

Considerations:

Batch size and thread pool size are adjustable depending on the performance of your system and the Okta API rate limits.

Ensure that Okta's rate limits are respected. You may need to throttle requests if necessary by adding a delay between tasks.

Proper error handling and retry mechanisms should be added for real-world scenarios, especially for large-scale migrations.

This approach will allow you to migrate millions of users efficiently while utilizing modern Java concurrency features.
